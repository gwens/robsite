			<h2>
			Interview with the Composer</h2>
				<p>
<b>Rob's most recent work continues to evolve a truly contemporary style, with a refreshing directness of expression.  It draws on the often diffuse innovations of the last century, aiming at a musical language, both unified and capable of a wide range of expression.  An intriguing work like the Oboe Concerto, which takes as its starting point the closing bars of Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony, illustrates a stage in what is obviously a continuing quest.  A quest to reconcile the traditional and the modern in a way which is new, which avoids retrospective leanings, and which it is hoped will appeal to its audience.</b>
</p>

<p>

<div class="question">
Who amongst recent composers have most influenced  your style?</div>


<p>
<b>RS</b> I have been drawn to many, often very different composers - for instance to the highly individual world of George Crumb or the techniques of Steve Reich.  But the single living composer who has excited me more than any other, I would say, is Boulez.  <br>
<p>

<div class="question">
What is it that attracts you to Boulez' music?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> His wonderful ear for timbre - for instrumentation generally.  You can hear a whole line of descent from Debussy, through Messiaen - especially in his later works.  Also his rhythmic freedom and vitality.<br>
<p>

<div class="question">What then of other members of the post-Webern generation?  Have these interested you at all?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> My discoveries here, as elsewhere, have unfolded gradually - in my search for my own language.  Much of the boldest experiment of the post war generations has come to enthrall me - Cage, Stockhausen, Berio, Ligeti.  I wouldn't say though that my music <i>sounds</i> like any of those I have mentioned - at least to any marked degree.  You hope - after your earliest efforts at least  - to be able to absorb and assimilate influences - to make them part of yourself.
<p>
<div class="question">
What then of those 'early efforts' - looking back to your student days. You completed and had performed a symphony during your first year at the RCM did you not?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Well, yes.  I should say it was very much a student work.  I wanted to do something quite bold and experimental - at least for me at that time - to explore a language of greater dissonance than I had done hitherto, and especially to aim at thematic integration.<br>
<p>
<div class="question">
Did you have any particular models in mind when writing it?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Yes, I would say - so far as thematic integration was concerned - Sibelius. The 4th Symphony especially fascinated me.  My passion for Bart&#243;k was also well established by then, but I can hear his influence only slightly.  There's a hint of Berg perhaps, as I had recently encountered <i>Wozzeck</i>, and the <i>Lulu Suite</i>, amongst other things.<br>
<p>

<div class="question">I believe this symphony was submitted for a masterclass by the legendary Nadia Boulanger?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Yes - she used to come over from Paris once a year to the RCM . She was a formidable figure. I got off quite lightly, I remember - she was even quite complimentary about bits of it!  It was an incredible experience - to have just caught her, right at the very end of her life.
<p>

<div class="question">You wrote further orchestral pieces, as well as vocal works, while at the RCM.</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Yes, I came under the influence of modality for a while and was attracted to the music of Holst especially - there was a fine performance of <i>Savitri</i> I remember, while I was at College.  I was interested by the asymmetry of his rhythms and his use of ostinato patterns for example - also by his mystical leanings.  You can hear his influence in <i>Visions of William Blake</i>, I think, which I wrote soon after leaving the RCM.<br>

<p>
<div class="question">When did you feel that you had found your own voice as a composer?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> I suppose <i>Youth, Sun & Moon</i>, a piece I wrote for the Purcell School, marked a clear step forward.  I can certainly hear Bart&#243;k's influence here - with some Holst in the background - but I think it has a distinct flavour which is mine.  I also became acquainted with Messiaen's modes at about this time. <br>

<p>
<div class="question">You mention Messiaen.  Has he been an important influence?
</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Oh yes - in fact I encountered the very different worlds of Messiaen and Tippett during the same period, and both affected my thinking very much.  Aiming at a certain simplicity and directness of expression, I was very attracted by non-conventional scales of all kinds - including Messiaen's modes - as sources of melody and especially harmony - attracted by new ways of presenting often familiar sounds in unfamiliar, yet beguiling ways.  Messiaen's ideas on rhythm also interested me greatly.<br>

<p>
<div class="question">And what about Tippett?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Again it was his approach to rhythm especially - his wonderful sprung rhythms and consequent vitality.<br>

<p>
<div class="question">Earlier you mentioned the importance to you of Boulez.  Have you then been interested in serialism at all?</div>

<p>
<b>RS</b> Yes - increasingly so - as I have discovered more and more of its creative possibilities - as  a technical ally if you like in trying to form a distinctive language of my own.  It was once seen too much as a 'system', rather than a new imaginative resource.  The first piece in which I used series extensively was <i>The Seagull</i>. For me though, style is very much linked with technique, which I have continually sought to develop - so it is an ongoing process.  All the various influences need time to be absorbed and assimilated.<br>
